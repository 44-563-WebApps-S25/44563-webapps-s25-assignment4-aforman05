        <h3> The Tempest </h3>
        <h6> Act 3, Scene 1 Before Prospero's Cell from the Tempest In this scene, Ferdinand is laboring under Prosperoâ€™s orders, carrying logs as a test of his devotion to Miranda. Despite the hardship, he finds joy in his work because of his love for her. Miranda, moved by his suffering, offers to help, but Ferdinand refuses, praising her virtue and beauty. They confess their love for each other, and Ferdinand promises to marry her, which Miranda eagerly accepts. Unseen, Prospero watches their exchange, pleased with the development of their relationship. </h6>

            <p class="direction"> Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log </p>
<h4 class="ferdinand"> FERDINAND </h4>
<p class="speech"> There be some sports are painful, and their labour
Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,
And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
Had never like executor. I forget:
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
Most busy lest, when I do it. </p>
<p class="direction"> Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen </p>

<h4 class="miranda"> MIRANDA </h4>
<p class="speech"> Alas, now, pray you,
Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;
He's safe for these three hours. </p>
<h4 class="ferdinand"> FERDINAND </h4>
<p class="speech"> O most dear mistress,
The sun will set before I shall discharge
What I must strive to do. </p>
<h4 class="miranda"> MIRANDA </h4>
<p class="speech"> If you'll sit down,
I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;
I'll carry it to the pile. </p>
<h4 class="ferdinand"> FERDINAND </h4>
<p class="speech"> No, precious creature;
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
Than you should such dishonour undergo,
While I sit lazy by. </p>
<h4 class="miranda"> MIRANDA </h4>
<p class="speech"> It would become me
As well as it does you: and I should do it
With much more ease; for my good will is to it,
And yours it is against. </p>
<h4 class="prospero"> PROSPERO </h4>
<p class="speech"> Poor worm, thou art infected!
This visitation shows it. </p>
<h4 class="miranda"> MIRANDA </h4>
<p class="speech"> You look wearily. </p>
<h4 class="ferdinand"> FERDINAND </h4>
<p class="speech"> No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with me
When you are by at night. I do beseech you--
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
What is your name? </p>
<h4 class="miranda"> MIRANDA </h4>
<p class="speech"> Miranda.--O my father,
I have broke your hest to say so! </p>
